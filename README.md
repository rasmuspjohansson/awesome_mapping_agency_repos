# Awesome Mapping Agency Repositories

A collection of GEO/ML GitHub repositories from different mapping agencies.


## Denmark

**Danish KDS**

- [ML_geo_production](https://github.com/SDFIdk/ML_geo_production): Using ensambles of semantic segmentation models in production. (used for building change detection)
- [laz-superpoint_transformer](https://github.com/SDFIdk/laz-superpoint_transformer): Training and inference for LiDAR point cloud(.laz) (proof of concept stage but works very well) 
- [ML_sdfi_fastai2](https://github.com/SDFIdk/ML_sdfi_fastai2): Training and validation of semantic segmetnation models with fastai2 (used for training all semantic segmetnation models at KDS)
- [ML_object_detection](https://github.com/SDFIdk/ML_object_detection): training and inference with yolo models for object detection. The detection code can produce huge images and creates labelme ready .json files. 
- [permeable surfaces](https://dataforsyningen.dk/labs/2259)   : using resent34 unets with multichannel images made up of rgb-Nir-ortofoto, DSM, DTM and obliqe rgb-nir-images. This is an interactive map you can explore 


## Spain

**ICGC**
